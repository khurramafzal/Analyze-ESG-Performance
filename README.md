# Analyze-ESG-Performance
Environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) is an increasingly important topic of
consideration for businesses of all sizes. Individual investors, as well as larger financial institutions,
are looking to ensure that the companies they are investing in are operating in a way that is both
ethical and sustainable. As such, companies are placing a larger emphasis not only on implementing
ESG policies, but also communicating these initiatives and metrics to investors in the market.

Typically released on their websites on a yearly basis in the form of a PDF document, companies
communicate their key ESG initiatives across multiple themes. These include how they value their
employees, clients or customers, how they positively contribute back to society, and especially how
they reduce (or are committing to reduce) their carbon emissions. Consumed by third parties
agencies, these reports are usually consolidated and benchmarked across industries to create ESG
metrics. However, it would be useful to be able to extract this information in an automatic way to be
able to efficiently evaluate new reports or companies.
